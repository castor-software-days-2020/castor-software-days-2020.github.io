#### Abstract
Continuous improvement is a part of DevOps and of the Agile way of working. Improvement is great but if you can't visualize it, it does not exist. So how do we visualize the development to operations and vice versa?

#### Bio
With a background from System Engineering to all kinds of test levels I have developed a passion for DevOps and its practices.
