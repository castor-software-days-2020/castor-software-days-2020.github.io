#### Abstract
Detection out-of-distribution and anomalous data samples is important for identifying rare classes, unexplored parts of the training data space and adversarial or novel behavior. 
In this talk I will discuss how to tackle this problem by modelling the training data density with deep generative models. I will give a short introduction to deep generative models and then focus on 
variational autoencoders (VAEs)  in specific. Since the standard VAE model can fail to detect anomalies, I propose to replace parts of the model with a Gaussian Process. A Gaussian Process represents 
test data points as a function of their distance to the training samples, which makes it possible to detect anomalies with a higher accuracy. Finally I describe how to use this altered model for anomaly 
detection in real world applications.TBA
