#### Abstract
Software systems contain resilience code to handle those failures and unexpected events happening in production. It is essential for developers to understand and assess the resilience of their systems. Chaos engineering is a technology that aims at assessing resilience and uncovering weaknesses by actively injecting perturbations in production. In this talk, I present a novel design and implementation of a chaos engineering system in Java called ChaosMachine. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05246
