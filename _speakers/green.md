#### Abstract
In this talk I will discuss some of the unique challenges that we see in adopting cloud native concepts and technology within the Radio Access Network (RAN) area and present an outlook on drivers that I believe will shape the software systems of the future RAN. The talk will touch on topics such as edge cloud, dynamic infrastructure, ultra-reliable and low latency, network simulations and cloud native and is intended as an introduction to the problem area and a call for further research collaboration.
