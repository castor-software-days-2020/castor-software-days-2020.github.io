We invite you to the first hackathon about art and continuous integration.
Passionate and creative software students, software developers, artists, designers and curious citizens are welcome to join this first ever performance of software art based on continuous integration data. Hackathon site, [here](https://kth.github.io/ci-hackathon/)


## The Concept

In this hackathon, we will dive into the extraordinary activity that occurs in a continuous integration server through visual and sound representations.

The goal is to build beautiful visualizations or sonifications of continuous integration (of compilations, test, analysis, packaging, deployment). These representations can be purely visual with beautiful images (still), videos (moving, à la [Gource](https://gource.io/)), or soundtracks (e.g., the sound of the continuous factory of open source software can be synthesized with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)).

The hackathon will be based on the stream of [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) builds provided through the [travis websocket](ws://travis.durieux.me). Examples of artistic representations of Travis include the [rain of commit messages](https://travis.durieux.me/rain.html), the [forest of builds](https://travis.durieux.me/tree/) or the [sound of programming languages](https://kth.github.io/ci-hackathon/solutions/Jacarte_bbaudry_pulse_of_travis/index.html).

More inspirations for such  visual representations of software can be found at the [CoDeDoc exhibition at the Whitney Museum](https://artport.whitney.org/commissions/codedoc/index.shtml). Representations can also be based on sound, through the sonification of the CI activity. Participants can be inspired by the [sonification of the continuous activity of wikipedia](http://listen.hatnote.com/).

## The Venue

The hackathon will take place in a very peculiar venue, the old structure of the very first nuclear reactor of Sweden, called [KTH R1](https://www.r1.kth.se/). It was a research reactor located on the main campus of KTH at Valhallavägen, and was active from 1954 to 1970. It was completely dismantled, and there is nothing left of it today. It is in the reactor hall that our hackathon will take place.
