#### Abstract
Autonomy introduces new dimensions in the complexity of software, which require breakthroughs in assurance technologies and certification processes. This talk reviews our work on verification of autonomy in the context of two applications: autonomous navigation of  search-and-rescue drones; the next generation airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS X) for commercial aircraft. Through these applications we identify unique challenges that autonomy poses for verification and validation, and discuss approaches for addressing them.
