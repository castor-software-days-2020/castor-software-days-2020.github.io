#### Abstract
The curl projected started in 1998 and is currently running in more than six billion installtions world-wide. It is widely considered to be the defacto multi platform URL transfer library and it is the empowering foundation of countless apps and millions of web sites and in billions of devices.

Daniel talks about how the curl project ended up like this without any particular company backing and where twenty years of development have taken us. How is this project managed, how has the success changed us, what's coming up next and how come the project never gets done?
